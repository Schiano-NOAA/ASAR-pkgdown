\usage{
add_section(
  sec_names = NULL,
  location = NULL,
  other_sections = NULL,
  subdir = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sec_names}{section_names of the subsection. Please keep this short as the template
will be created as a quarto document into your skeleton and saved
later for reference. More than one section can be added. Please
make a list if this is desired.}

\item{location}{Where the section will be added in the generic template using
the notation of 'placement-section'. Example would be 'in-introduction'
where the new content would be created as a child document
and added into the 02_introduction.qmd. There is an option to
add more than one section. Add the location as a list
corresponding to the order of section names listed in the
'title' parameter}

\item{other_sections}{List of other sections that the added sections will be combined with (if not NULL)}

\item{subdir}{directory where the new sections will be saved - in the create_template
fxn this defaults to the location where the template is saved}
}
\value{
Add an additional section to the report template if it is not already
in the default template. This provides the option to adding it as a
subsection either before or after it or within the subsection itself
as a child document.
